Release Notes for NexJ Scheme
=============================

2011/01 - Release 7.1.13.0
--------------------------
Updated NexJ Scheme to R6RS:
   - Nearly complete implementation of R6RS Base Library Functions
   - Nearly complete implementation of R6RS Standard Library Functions for the
     following groups:
      * unicode, bytevectors, list, sorting, control structures, some I/O,
        arithmetic (only bitwise functions), hashtables, eval, mutable pairs,
        R5RS compatibility
   - The following R6RS Standard Library Functions are not implemented:
      * records, exceptions, some I/O, arithmetic (bitwise is implemented),
        syntax-case, enumerations, mutable strings

Additional features specific to NexJ Scheme:
   - hashset functions
   - additional (make-hashtable) constructors
   - a destructive list append function: (append!)
   - Half-up rounding: (round-at)
   - OID serialization: (oid->string) and (string->oid)
   - Additional bytevectors functions: (bytevector) and (bytevector-append)
   - Vector and bytevector are callable types
      * (define v (vector 5 6 7))   ; creates a vector
      * (v 1)    ; returns value at index 1 (6)
      * (v 1 9)  ; sets value at index 1 to 9 and returns 9
   - A macro that wraps multiple return values in a list: (values->list)
   - Several R6RS list functions also work for vector and collection objects

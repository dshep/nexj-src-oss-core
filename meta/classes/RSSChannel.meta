The cloud can determine the IP address of the caller from the request. A workstation cannot make a registration call on behalf of another. The cloud returns true if it was able to do the registration, false otherwise.&#10;&#10;When a subscribed-to channel changes the cloud calls back to the procedure named in the registration call with one parameter, the url of the channel that changed. At that point the workstation could read the channel, or notify other workstations that the channel has changed, clear a cache, send an email or do nothing. The workstation returns true.&#10;&#10;By convention registrations expire after 25 hours.
